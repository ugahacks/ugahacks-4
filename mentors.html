						ask for help when it's something quick. We encourage you to be active on
						Slack and answer questions from participants whenever they're asked. You 
						should have received an invite link via email. Otherwise, you can also join via
						<a href="http://slack.ugahacks.com">slack.ugahacks.com</a> during the event.

					<h1>Get to know people</h1>
					<p>
						Often times, it's easier to help someone once you get to know them a bit.
						Whenever you're not busy, take some time to walk around and get engaged with
						hackers to see what they're building. 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Be open minded</h1>
					<p>
						A great thing about hackathons is that you never know what projects can come 
						from it. Students use this time to explore new and innovative ways to use
						technologies to tackle problems they find in the world. Sometimes, your views
						may not align with theirs and that's okay. 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Be available</h1>
					<p>
						No, this doesn't mean you need to be awake at 4 AM helping a team. Whenever a team
						or student comes to you for help, be open with them about what you know and don't 
						know. It's okay to say "I don't know the answer to that, but I'll help you find it."
						A great thing about being a mentor is that you'll learn something from it too!
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>No recruiting</h1>
					<p>
						Please remember that as a mentor, you are representing yourself. While we greatly 
						appreciate your time and dedication towards helping hackers, a mentor should help
						students with their projects or give advice - not recruit for a company. If your
						company wishes to recruit at UGAHacks, please consider sponsoring instead.

					<h1>Know your audience</h1>
					<p>Determine whether you want to target advanced or beginner/intermediate. 
						Focusing your efforts towards one group can greatly improve the quality
						of your workshop by not jumping back and forth, confusing both groups.
						If you would like advice, please feel free to reach out to us.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Give them shoes and let them run</h1>
					<p>Unfortunately, although the 48 hours will be fun and fruitful, it usually 
						isn't enough time for us to include everything there is to learn about 
						the subject you'll be speaking about, we recommend laying down the basics 
						during the workshop and providing supplementary materials that participants
						can view on their own after or on their own time!
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Visual Aids are helpful</h1>
					<p>You will have access to a projector with either an HDMI or VGA connection.</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Let participants know ahead of time</h1>
					<p>Be sure to specify any materials (including software to download) that 
						participants should come with -- download times can really hinder workshop time! 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Relax and have fun</h1>
					<p>Have fun, and feel free to reach out the team if you need any further assistance or 
						feedback -- we would love to help!

						While UGAHacks is unable to provide sleeping accommodations apart from bringing a sleeping bag

						which are available at your expense. UGAHacks is not associated with any of the listed hotels.
