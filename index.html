					<h3>Where? </h3>
					<p>
						The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ufiFo4PmKb82">Lamar Dodd School of Art</a>, University of Georgia, Athens, GA.
						We're very excited about the very large venue upgrade this year, and we'll be posting parking information very
						soon!
					</p>
					<h3>Who can sign up? </h3>
					<p>
						All university students! We welcome all undergraduates and graduate students of all skill levels to attend.
						Professionals
						and other guests are
						welcome to attend as mentors or volunteers.
					</p>
					<h3>How much will it cost to sign up? </h3>
					<p>
						Nothing! The entire event and its amazing perks are free for all participants, including meals and snacks to keep
						you powered throughout the weekend, as well as workshops to help you get started and sharpen your hacking skills.
					</p>
					<h3>What should I bring? </h3>
					<p>
						Enthusiasm! Laptops, phones, chargers, and other tools you might need for your project are also important! If
						you're staying overnight, be sure to bring the necessary toiletries and a sleeping bag. Additionally, please
						bring your official student ID or government ID (no photocopies allowed).
					</p>
					<h3>Can I start working on my project before the event? </h3>
					<p>
						No. All UGAHacks projects must begin at the hackathon. You are not permitted to begin a hackathon project before
						this event. Feel free to bring ideas, but no code!
					</p>
					<h3>What if I don't have a team or idea? </h3>
					<p>
						Don't sweat it! You're free to join any existing team or form a new one when you get there. We'll also provide
						ample opportunities for hackers to meet each other and brainstorm some amazing ideas.
					</p>
					<h3>How many people can I have on my team? </h3>
					<p>
						There is no hard limit, but we recommend teams be at most 4 people, as we only have prizes for 4 people per team.
					</p>
					<h3>Will you be offering travel reimbursements? </h3>
					<p>
						Yes, we will be offering travel reimbursements! Please make sure to note it on your registration and we will
						reach out to you upon acceptance. University of Georgia students are not eligible to receive travel
						reimbursements.
					</p>
					<h3>Where will I sleep? </h3>
					<p>
						We'll have designated sleeping areas for hackers, but they will be on a first-come-first-serve basis. You're
						welcome and even encouraged to bring a sleeping bag!
					</p>
					<h3>Can I volunteer / mentor at UGAHacks? </h3>
					<p>
						We love your enthusiasm! Volunteers and mentors can apply via the registration form above! If you have any
						questions regarding the position, please contact us at
						<a href="mailto:hackathon@uga.edu">hackathon@uga.edu</a>
						- Be sure to mention it in the subject. See you soon!
					</p>
					<h3>I have more questions? </h3>
					<p>
						That's not actually a question, but if you've got one then we'll be happy to answer it! Reach out to us at
						<a href="mailto:hello@ugahacks.com">hello@ugahacks.com</a>.
