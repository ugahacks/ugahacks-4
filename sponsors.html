					<p>
						Your company can engage with us on social media by using the hashtag 
						#UGAHacks or tagging us @UGAHacks on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
						We'll share photos and post taken throughout the event.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h1>Slack</h1>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Each sponsor has access to their own slack channel. Slack is an excellent
						opportunity to engage with participants outside of workshop times or
						before/after they visit your booth. You can use the '@channel' tag to 
						send a notification to everyone in your channel. By default, all participants
						will automatically be enrolled in your specific channel.

					<h1>Table Cloth</h1>
					<p>Company branded table cloths can help make your table 
						stand out from the other tables, giving your brand a more unique look.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Banners</h1>
					<p>If you have any vertical banners, feel free to bring them to 
						showcase what your company is all about.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Recruiting</h1>
					<p>If you plan on recruiting at the event, be sure to have brochures 
						or flyers detailing your program because let's face it, college students tend 
						to forget things quite often.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Swag</h1>
					<p>Giving out promotional items for participants is a great way to increase
						engagement and encourage students to take a look at what your table has to offer. Common
						swag items include t-shirts, fidget spinners, flash lights, and stickers. Feel free
						to get creative!

				</div>
				<div class="boxtext">
					<h1>Know your audience</h1>
					<p>Determine whether you want to target advanced or beginner/intermediate. 
						Focusing your efforts towards one group can greatly improve the quality
						of your workshop by not jumping back and forth, confusing both groups.
						If you would like advice, please feel free to reach out to us.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Give them shoes and let them run</h1>
					<p>Unfortunately, although the 48 hours will be fun and fruitful, it usually 
						isn't enough time for us to include everything there is to learn about 
						the subject you'll be speaking about, we recommend laying down the basics 
						during the workshop and providing supplementary materials that participants
						can view on their own after or on their own time!
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Visual Aids are helpful</h1>
					<p>You will have access to a projector with either an HDMI or VGA connection.</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Let participants know ahead of time</h1>
					<p>Be sure to specify any materials (including software to download) that 
						participants should come with -- download times can really hinder workshop time! 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h1>Relax and have fun</h1>
					<p>Have fun, and feel free to reach out the team if you need any further assistance or feedback -- we would love to help!
