					<p>UGAHacks is an annual hackathon at the University of Georgia.</p>
					<br>
                    <p>This year will mark our organization’s fourth official hackathon, 
						and we hope to bring in both newcomers and experienced hackers alike.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Our greatest aspiration is to provide a worthwhile experience for every participant and contributor.</p>
					<br>
                    <p>Whether this may come in the form of providing motivation, expertise, and time to execute projects, 
						or providing tools that the participants need to increase their skills, 
						our hope is that it will be a meaningful event and time to those involved.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the end of the day, UGAHacks 4 is about sprouting your ideas to life.</p>
